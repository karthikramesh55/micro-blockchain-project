# Micro-Blockchain Project

An attempt at building a mini-blockchain using Python with multiple functionalities such as creating and loading a trading wallet for transactions, mining user-generated blocks, rewarding system for block mining, hashing of private/public key via RSA and SHA256 encryption, verifying the Proof of Work (PoW) to confirm the addition of a block to a chain.

Future action pipeline: Creating a peer node network, implementing a consensus algorithm to validate the blockchain and broadcasting transactions to peer nodes for consensus.
